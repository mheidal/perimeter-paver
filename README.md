## Perimeter Paver

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/). It is published on [the Factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/perimeter-paver) in .zip format. The source code is visible on [the Github page](https://github.com/mheidal/perimeter-paver/).

This mod introduces a customizable tool accessible through the default shortcut 'CTRL + SHIFT + P' or the shortcut bar. To use the tool, select a 'basis tile' and a list of tiles to encircle it. Simply click the 'Create blueprint' button with a blueprint containing your chosen basis tile, and the tool will generate a blueprint that surrounds all instances of the basis tile with layers of the selected tiles. Once configured, you can toggle a setting to prevent the GUI from reopening, enabling you to quickly create blueprints without interruption.

This mod was initially created to automate decoration of spaceships in Space Exploration.

### Planned Features
- Create and choose between multiple configurations of tile layers.

- Pave under and around entities in a blueprint.
    - Pave under all entities
    - Pave under specific filtered entities or types of entities (e.g. rails)
